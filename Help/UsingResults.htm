    <h1>Using Results</h1>
    
    <p>The Results panel displays the output from using the Identify
        tool, from a search using Find, or from other operations that
        output information.</p>
        
    <h4>To open the Results window</h4>
    
    <ul>
        <li>Results panel expands automatically after performing a
            <a href="Searching.htm">search</a>
            or after you choose the option to add features found
            with the <a href="identify.htm">Identify</a> tool
            to the Results panel.</li>
        <li>You can also expand Results by clicking its down-arrow
            in the <a href="GettingStarted.htm#Console">
            Console</a>. If you open
            Results before doing any search or Identify, the Results
            panel will be blank.</li>
        <li>You can collapse
            the Results panel to its title bar by clicking the
            collapse icon.</li>
        <li>You can resize the height of Results 
            by clicking and dragging the bottom of the
            Results section.</li>
        <li>If Results is re-opened, previous results will
            still be visible, along with any new ones
            just found.</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4>Navigating the Results window</h4>
    
    <table>
    <tr>
    
    <td valign="top">
    
        <ul>
            <li>After doing a search or adding results from Identify, an item will be added to Results.</li>
            <li>If you do another search or add another result from Identify, the new results items
                are added to the top of the list in Results. 
                Previous items remain in the list.</li>
            <li>To see information associated with a Location or Find result,
                click the plus icon 
                <img src="images/plus.gif" />
                to the left of the item.</li>
            <li>When you expand a results item, you will see
                one or more <b>layer</b> names. Expand a layer to see
                the features found within that layer at the location.
                Features are listed using the value of 
                the first string field in the attributes.</li>
            <li>To see details for a <b>feature</b>, click its plus icon
                <img src="images/plus.gif" />.
                This displays attribute <b>field names and values</b>
                for the feature.<br /><br /></li>
            <li>Right-click on an item in Results for options:

    <h4>
        Interacting with results items and map graphics</h4>
    <p>
        You can hover over features in the Results, and the corresponding graphic on the
        map will change color temporarily. This allows you to quickly determine the location
        of features listed in the Results window.</p>
    <p>
        You can hover over a graphic for a feature on the map and the feature will temporarily
        change color. A label, if available, will also be temporarily displayed for the
        feature. You can then click on the graphic or the label and the label will expand
        to display all available attributes for the feature. You may scroll through the
        list of attributes. When you move the cursor away from the graphic, label or box,
        these items will be hidden. This allows you to easily explore the features highlighted
        on the map.</p>
    <h4>
        Selecting with the Results window</h4>
    
    <p>
        Features may be selected (highlighted) on the map by clicking
        the check-box next to feature
        names:
        <img align="absBottom" src="images/Results_checkbox.gif" />
        . Most tasks select features when they are added to the Results. By default the highlighting
        has a cyan (blue-green) outline or fill, but this may be set to a different color
        by the creator of the map service. To unselect features uncheck them in the
        Results window. You can unselect an entire layer or result set by unchecking its
        check-box in the Results window.</p>
        
    <h4>Zooming to Features</h4>
    <p>You can zoom to one or more features in the Results window. See
        the table above for illustrations of the right-click menus.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>To zoom to a single feature, right-click the feature's name 
            (next to the plus icon), and in the pop-up menu, choose <b>Zoom to</b>.</li>
        <li>To zoom to multiple features in a layer, click in the checkboxes
            of the features, then right-click on the Layer name, and choose
            <b>Zoom To Selected Features</b>.</li>
    </ul>
