    <p>The Web mapping application may allow you to print the map
        and the results from search and other operations.</p>
    
    <h4>To print the map and results</h4>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Zoom or pan the map to the area you wish to print.</li>
        
        <li>Optionally, use available tasks to display results in the
            Results area of the Console.</li>
    
        <li>Display the <strong>Print</strong> task dialog by clicking its name in
            the <a href="GettingStarted.htm">menu area</a>. If no
            Print link is displayed, then printing is not available as
            a task in this application. </li>
            
        <li>In the Print dialog, choose options as desired for printing.

                    included on the print page.</li>
                <li><b>Map Size</b>: set the size of the map. The actual size
                    depends on how the administrator configured the website.</li>
                <li><b>Print table of results for</b>: if displayed, the listed items

                <li><b>Map Quality</b>: if enabled for your application, you
                    may be able to select the quality of the map, such as choosing

            </ul>

        <li>Click <b>Create Print Page</b> to generate the print-preview
            page, which opens in a new window. If the window does not open,
            check to ensure that any pop-up blockers in your browser are not
            blocking this website.
            </li>
