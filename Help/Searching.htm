    <h1>Search for features</h1>
    
    <p>The Web mapping application may allow you to search and find
        features of interest to you. The searching tools that are available
        will depend on how your application is configured.</p>
    
    <h4>Search, find and query tasks</h4>
    
    <p>The website may enable you to search one or more layers for
        text that you enter, to find an address,
        or to search for places using a Web database. 
        The administrator of the website 
        determines the types of searches available.</p>
        
    <p>For example, the query may ask you to enter a value for
        the name of a city. A more complex query may ask for two or
        more values, and search using these values. For example, a
        query may ask for a city name and country name. The query
        might use the values you enter to look for a city with the name 
        and that is in the country you entered.</p>
        
    <ol>
        <li>The search or find task can be displayed by clicking its name in
            the <a href="GettingStarted.htm">menu area</a>. </li>
            
        <li>The search or find task opens in a new dialog window within the
            mapping application. 
            Some examples of possible tasks are shown below.
            This dialog window may be moved,
            collapsed, and closed. See <a href="GettingStarted.htm#FloatingWindows">
            Getting Started</a>
            for details on using moveable windows.<br />
            <table border="0"><tr valign="top">
                <td><img src="images/PredefinedQuery.gif" alt="Query task example" /></td>
                <td width="30">&nbsp;</td>
                <td><img src="images/FindAddressTask.gif" alt="Find address example" /></td>
            </tr></table>
            
            </li>
            
        <li>Enter text you want to search for in the input boxes
            of the task window. The task may require entering all of the
            value, or part of the value. The task text should give a hint
            about what you need to enter to find features. </li>
            
        <li>Click the dialog submit button (<b>Find</b>, etc.) to start the search.</li>
            
        <li>The <a href="UsingResults.htm">Results</a> section
            expands in the Console to display results
            of the search (if it does not expand automatically,
            click the down-arrow in the Results section to display it). 
            The text searched for displays in the
            results item. </li>
            
        <li>
            If features are found, a plus button
            <img src="images/plus.gif" alt="Treeview plus button" /> 
            appears next to the results item. Click the
            plus button to expand and explore the results. 
            The example below shows one possible result of a search using Find.<br />
            <img src="images/Find_results.gif" alt="Find results example" />
            </li>
            
        <li>The results display one or more layers where features
            are found. Click the plus button next to a layer
            to display features found. For more details on using
            the Results window, see 
            <a href="UsingResults.htm">Using Results</a>.</li>
