    <h1>Measure distance and area</h1>
    
    <p>You can use the Measure tool to measure distances and areas. 
    To use one of these tools, open the Measure dialog and then use
    the appropriate tool.</p>
    
    <ul>
        <li><a href="#MeasureDialog">To open the Measure dialog</a></li>
        <li><a href="#MeasureLine">To measure a line</a></li>
        <li><a href="#MeasurePolygon">To measure a polygon</a></li>
        <li><a href="#FindCoordinates">To find X,Y coordinates</a></li>
    </ul>
    
    <h4><a name="MeasureDialog"></a>
        To open the Measure dialog</h4>
    
    <ol>
    
        <li>In the <a href="ToolReference.htm">Toolbar</a>,
            click the <b>Measure</b> icon
            <img src="../images/measure.png" align="absmiddle" />. 
            If the Measure icon is not visible, then the Measure
            tool is not available for this application.</li>
            
        <li>This opens the
            Measure element dialog.<br /><br />
            <img src="images/MeasureDialog.gif" /><br /><br />
            
            See the instructions below depending on whether you want
            to measure a line or to measure area. You can also use the point
            option to find the x,y coordinates of a location on the map.
        </li>
        
        <li>After measuring, you can close the Measure dialog
            by clicking on its Close icon
            in the upper right, or by clicking any other tool in the
            Tools element (Zoom in, Zoom out, Pan, etc.)</li>
            
    </ol>
    
    <h4><a name="MeasureLine"></a>
        To measure a line</h4>
    
    <ol>
            
        <li>In the Measure dialog, click the Line icon 
            <img src="../images/measure-line.png" />. 
            The Line icon is outlined to show it is the active type.
            </li>
               
        <li>Move the cursor to the first point of the line you want to
            measure, and click the left mouse button. As you move the
            mouse from this location, you will see the line stretching
            to the current position. The measure dialog will also begin
            to display distance.
        </li>
        
        <li>Move the cursor to the second point of the line. If you only
            want to measure one straight-line segment, double-click at
            this location. Otherwise click once with the left mouse button.
        </li>
        
        <li>If measuring a line with multiple segments (polyline),
            continue clicking at vertices to add segments. The length
            of the previous segment is shown in the <b>Segment</b>
            display in the Measure dialog. The <b>Total Length</b>
            displays the sum of segments added so far.<br />
            <img src="images/MeasureLine.gif" />
            </li>
            
         <li>At any point during the measuring, you can change 
            the units for measuring distance by using the drop-down list
            in the measure dialog. 
            You can also change units after completing the measurement.
            </li>
            
        <li>At the last vertex, double-click to end the line.
            The <b>Total Length</b> displays the length of the
            line, including all segments if multiple ones were drawn.
            You can change the units drop-down list to see the same line
            expressed with different units.</li>
            
        <li>To draw a new line, simply click on the map to start
            the new line. This erases the previous line.</li>
            
        <li>To erase the line from the map, click any of the measure type
            icons in the Measure dialog. If you click
            any other tool in the Tools element, this will close the
            Measure dialog, and any line or polygon will also be erased.</li>
    
    </ol>
    
    <h4><a name="MeasurePolygon"></a>
        To measure area</h4>
    
    <ol>
    
        <li>In the Measure dialog,  click the Polygon icon
            <img src="../images/measure-poly.png" />.
            The Polygon icon is outlined to show it is the
            active type, and the dialog changes to show information
            on measuring polygons.
            </li>
            
        <li>Set the units for measuring distance. 
            For polygons, the measured area displays in the Area Units,
            and the perimeter displays in the Distance Units.</li>
            
        <li>Click the left mouse button at the first point in
            the polygon. As you move the
            mouse from this location, you will see the line stretching
            to the current position.</li>
            
        <li>Click the second point of the polygon. The first segment
            draws, and the polygon now stretches to the current position
            from the last point as well as to the initial point. When
            you click the third point, the measure dialog displays the
            perimeter and area of the polygon based on the vertices added. The total is
            updated as you add more vertices.<br />
            <img src="images/MeasurePolygon.gif" />
            </li>
            
        <li>Continue adding points (vertices) of the polygon. New
            vertices add segments connecting to the previous vertex.
            </li>
            
        <li>At the last vertex in the polygon, double-click the mouse.
            You do not need to click at the original point again.
            Read the Area and Perimeter from the Measure dialog.
            You can change the Distance Units to see the same polygon
            expressed with different units.</li>
            
        <li>To draw a new polygon, simply click on the map to start
            the new polygon. This erases the previous polygon.</li>
            
        <li>To erase the polygon from the map, click any of the measure type 
            icons in the Measure dialog. If you click
            any other tool in the Tools element, this will close the
            Measure dialog, and any line or polygon will also be erased.</li>
    
    </ol>
    
    <h4><a name="FindCoordinates"></a>
        To find X,Y coordinates</h4>
        
    <p>The Measure dialog also allows finding the X,Y coordinates at
        a point where you click on the map.</p>
        
    <ol>
        <li>In the Measure dialog, click on the point symbol
            <img src="../images/measure-point.png" />.</li>
        
        <li>Click on the map. The coordinates at the location you clicked
            will be displayed in the Measure dialog.<br />
            <img src="images/MeasurePoint.gif" />
            </li>
    </ol>
    
    <p>The units and projection (spatial reference) of the coordinates 
        will be based on the map used in the web application.</p>
