            menu area</a> (the name of the task may vary). 
            The Editor task window will open. If the Editor link

            does not allow editing.</li>
            
        <li>In the Editor task window, a menu may display for selecting a version to edit. If
            so, choose a version from
            the drop-down list. Then click <b>Start Editing</b>.
            This closes the Editor task window and opens the

        <li>If the <strong>Save</strong> button is displayed in the Editor task window, 
            you must use the Save button to
            save your edits. If you make changes and then close
            the Editor task window, you will be asked whether to discard
            your changes: click OK to discard changes, or click Cancel
            to return to the Editor task window. If you make changes and simply
            close the browser without saving, your edits will
            not be saved. (If the Save button is not displayed,
            then your edits are saved immediately, and you do not need

    <p style="font-weight:bold">Snapping settings</p>
    
    <p>When you draw a line or polygon, you may want vertices
        (points) to fall exactly along other existing
        features. Snapping forces a click to take the precise coordinate
        of a feature, if the feature falls within the 
        <b>Snapping Tolerance</b> of the click.
        <br />
        <br />
        <strong>Snap tips</strong> are automatically available when editing. When adding
        or moving vertices, <strong>press and hold the 's' key</strong> to show a marker
        at the location to which the cursor will be snapped:
        <br />
        <img alt="Snap tip illustration" src="images/snap_tip.gif" /><br />
        The cursor does not actually snap to this location while drawing a line or polygon.
        But once you
        finish adding the feature, the snapped locations will be the ones used and displayed.</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li><b>Snapping Rules</b> determine which parts of features within
                a layer can be snapped to. For each layer, you can snap to
                specific locations within features.
            <ul>
                <li>Vertex: mouse click location will be snapped to the nearest vertex
                    in a feature of the layer, if within the snapping tolerance.</li>
                <li>Edge: mouse click location will be snapped to the nearest
                    line or polygon of a feature. Snapped location does not have
                    to fall on a vertex.</li>
                <li>End: mouse click location will be snapped to an end point
                    of a line or polygon.</li>
            </ul>
    
        </li>
    
        <li><b>Snapping Tolerance</b>: the location clicked with the mouse
        will be snapped only if it is within this distance of a feature.
        The smaller the snapping tolerance, the closer you must click
        to a feature in order to snap to it.</li>
            <li><strong>Show snap circle</strong>: when adding or moving vertices, displays a circle halo around the cursor as
                you move the mouse. This indicates the snapping tolerance. If a feature in a layer
                with snapping enabled is within this circle, depending on the snapping rules for
                end, vertex or edge. Be aware that enabling this option uses CPU time on your computer
                as you move the mouse.<br />

        <li><b>Tolerance:</b> When selecting features, features within
            this distance of the mouse click will be selected. This
            allows easier selection of point and line features.</li>
            
        <li><b>Limit selection to:</b> No more than this number of
            features can be selected at one time. This limits the
            potential load on the server and prevents inadvertently
            selecting large numbers of features.</li>
            
        <li><b>Selection Mode:</b> When using the Select Feature tool,
            this setting determines how the selection affects any features
            previously selected in the layer.
            <ul>
                <li>Create new selection: any features previously selected
                are unselected, and a new set is selected based on the
                area drawn with the Select Feature tool.</li>
                <li>Add to current selection: newly selected features are
                added to the set of features previously selected.</li>
                <li>Remove from current selection: features found when using
                the Select Feature tool are removed from the set previously
                selected. Remaining features, if any, are still selected.</li>
                <li>Toggle feature selection state: features intersecting the
                area drawn with the Select Features too that were not previously
                selected will be selected, while features previously selected
                will be un-selected. Features not intersecting the area drawn
                will remain selected.
                </li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            
        <li><b>Selection Color:</b> Selected features are shown
            with this color. To change the selection color, click the
            drop-down arrow, and choose a color from the palette.
        </li>
        
        <li><b>Show highlight:</b>If checked, displays the feature whose
            attributes are currently being editing with a separate highlight
            color. If this option is checked, the <b>Highlight Color</b>
            is displayed and may be set by clicking the drop-down arrow
            next to the color sample box,
            which displays the color palette for choosing a new color.</li>
    </ul>
