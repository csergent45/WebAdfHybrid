    <h1>Frequently asked questions and Troubleshooting</h1>
    
    <h4>I moved a map element (Tools, Results, etc.) off 
        the screen. How can I get it back?</h4>
    <p>If you accidentally move an element outside the visible
        window, you may move it back by using the browser's scrollbars
        to scroll the window until the element is visible, then
        drag it back to the main area of the window.</p>
        
    <h4>In Results from an identify or query, when I check a feature
        to highlight it on the map, the feature does not get highlighted.</h4>
    <p>The administrator of the site may have disabled this ability.
        If the map uses ArcIMS software and returning geometry is
        disabled, then the website won't highlight features.</p>
        
    <h4>Error messages</h4>
    
    <h5>An unhandled
        exception has occurred: There was an error in the callback.</h5>
    <p>The web application may have timed out. Try holding the Control
        key (Ctrl) down and clicking the browser's Refresh button to
        restart the web application. If the error continues, please
        report the problem to the website administrator.</p>
        
    <h5>Application Error - Page_Error - serverObject</h5>
    <p>In this case, the normal web page does not appear, just this error
        message. A number of problems may be causing this error. The
        server may have too many users. In this case, wait a few
        minutes and try the website again. Or the server may be down.
        If the problem persists, contact the website administrator.</p>
        
    <h5>Application Error - Page_Error - Error HRESULT E_FAIL has 
        been returned from a call to a COM component.</h5>
    <p>In this case, the normal web page does not appear, just this error 
        message. The cause may be that one or more of the GIS services
        that the website uses is not running. Ask the website
        administrator to check that the services used by the website
        are running and accessible to the website.</p>
