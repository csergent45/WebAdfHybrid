    <h1>Getting Started</h1>
    
    <p>
        The Web Mapping Application enables you to explore a map and
        find information useful to you.
    </p>
    
    <h4>How it works</h4>
    
    <table><tr><td valign="top">
        The Web Mapping Application page has three main parts:
        
        <ul>
            <li>Along the top, a set of <strong>links</strong> to this Help and other websites</li>
            <li>A menu of tasks, plus the <a href="ToolReference.htm">Toolbar</a>
                for interacting with the map.
                
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Tasks</b> enable you to find and interact with data. Available tasks
                        may include, depending on the application:
                        <ul>
                            <li><a href="Searching.htm">Find or search for features</a></li>
                            <li><a href="Searching.htm#FindAddressTask">Find address</a></li>
                            <li><a href="EditorTask.htm">Editing</a></li>
                            <li>Print</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><a href="UsingResults.htm">Results</a></li>
                    <li><a href="LayersAndToc.htm">Map Contents</a></li>
                    <li><a href="OverviewAndMagnifier.htm">Overview</a></li>
                </ul>
                
                </li>
            <li>Map</li>
            <li><a href="#TaskCenter">Console</a>, on the left side of the page, provides
                information about the map contents and also displays results when added to the Console.
                </li>
            
        </ul>
        </td>
        <td>
            <img src="images/AppWindow.jpg" /></td>
        </tr></table>
       
    <h4><a name="Console"></a>
        Working with the Console</h4>
        
    <p>You can hide and then show the Console as needed. Click the gray arrow
        <img src="images/hideShowTaskCenter.gif" />
        just to the left of the map to hide the Console. Click
        the arrow (which now
        points to the right) again to show the Console.</p>
    <p>
        You can resize the area used by the Console by clicking and dragging the divider
        between the Console and the Map. This allows more room to view either area as you
        work.</p>
        
    <p>You can expand and collapse sections as needed. Click the
        down arrow to expand a Console section:<br />
        <img src="images/taskExpand.gif" /><br />
        Click the up arrow in the title of a section to collapse it to its title bar:<br />
        <img src="images/taskCollapse.gif" /><br />
        The content of the section is hidden but not deleted. Expand
        the section to see the content again.</p>
        
    <p>Console sections can be resized in height.
        To resize a section height, move the cursor to the 
        bottom of the task section, until the up-down arrow
        appears. Click and hold the left mouse button,
        and drag the section up or down
        to resize.<br />
        <img src="images/resizeTaskSection.gif" /></p>
        
    <h4><a name="FloatingWindows"></a>
        Working with moveable elements</h4>
    
    <p>Some elements, such as the 
        <a href="Measuring.htm">Measure window</a> and the <a href="OverviewAndMagnifier.htm">Magnifier window</a>,
        may be moved around the page, collapsed and closed. 
        You can arrange these elements
        to suit your own work.</p>
    <p>To move elements, click and hold with the left mouse button
        on the title bar of the element. As you hover over the
        element's title bar, the cursor changes to a four-way arrow,
        indicating you can move it by clicking and dragging.
        <br />
        <img src="images/MovingElements.gif" /><br />
        Drag the element to the position you want, then release
        the mouse button.</p>
     <p>If you accidentally move an element outside the visible
        window, you may move it back by using the browser's scrollbars
        to scroll the window until the element is visible, then
        drag it back to the main area of the window.</p>
     <p>To collapse the element, click the up arrow in its 
        upper right corner. The element window collapses to its
        title bar. To restore it to normal view, click its down-arrow.</p>
     <p>Close a moveable window by clicking the close button it its
        upper right corner. Most such windows may be re-opened
        from the appropriate location. For example, the Measure
        and Magnifier windows may be re-opened from the Toolbar.</p>
        
     <h4>Resizing moveable elements</h4>
     
     <p>Some element windows, such as 
        <a href="OverviewAndMagnifier.htm">Magnifier</a>, 
        can be resized to show more or less area. To resize, move
        the mouse over the right or bottom edge of the element
        window until you see the cursor change to a double arrow.
        Hold the mouse down and drag the window edge to resize it,
        then release.<br />
