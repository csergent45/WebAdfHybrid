    <h1>Quick tour</h1>
    
    <p>The exact features in your Web mapping application may vary.
        This is a tour of some common features in many applications.</p>
    
    <ol>
    
        <li>Start the Web mapping application from the URL you
            have been given.</li>
                        
        <li>If you have a wheel mouse, zoom in on the map by
            moving the mouse over the map and <b>scrolling the wheel</b>
            forward a few times.</li>
            
        <li><b>Pan (re-center)</b> the map a few times by clicking and
            dragging on the map. The pan function is the default
            tool, active when the application starts.</li>
            
        <li>If the <a href="UsingTheMouse.htm">Navigation</a> arrow
            is available, click on one of the edges of the image 
            to pan (re-center) the map in the
            direction of the arrow. Then pan back in the opposite
            direction. Notice the map is already present in areas 
            you return to. This illustrates the caching functionality of
            the application.</li>
            
        <li>In the <a href="ToolReference.htm">Toolbar</a>,
            click the <b>Zoom In</b> tool 
            <img src="images/esriZoomIn.png" alt="Zoom-in tool" />, then click and drag
            on the map to draw a rectangle, and release the mouse button.
            The map zooms into the area of the rectangle. </li>
            
        <li>In the <a href="ToolReference.htm">Toolbar</a>,
            click the <b>Identify tool</b>
            <img src="../images/Identify.png" alt="Zoom-out tool" />. 
            Then click in the map
            on a feature you are interested in.
            A callout box pops up to display the name of a feature.
            <img src="images/identify_click.png" alt="Identify callout"
             style="vertical-align:top;" />
            <br />Click the drop-down arrow within the box to expand the
            box and display more details about the feature.
            </li>
            
        <li>Hover the mouse over the name of the feature at the top of
            the identify callout box. If more than one feature is
            found at the location you clicked, the name area will
            change into a drop-down box. 
            <img src="images/identify_mult.png" alt="Identify multiple"
             style="vertical-align:top;" /><br />
            Click the drop-down if available and click one of the
            other features. Details about that feature are shown in
            the identify callout box.</li>
            
        <li>Click the <b>Add to Results</b> link at the bottom of the
            callout box to add the feature to the Results area. The 
            <a href="UsingResults.htm">Results</a> section of the Console
            displays the location coordinates where you
            clicked. </li>
            
        <li>Expand the location in the <b>Results</b>
            window by clicking its plus sign, if not already expanded. 
            This shows the layers where
            features are found. Expand a layer to explore the features
            found. You can right-click on a feature and choose to Zoom To
            the feature. When finished, you can remove a results item by
            right-clicking with the mouse and choosing Remove. 
            </li>
            
        <li>If available in your application, 
            <b>find</b> features by using one of the <b>tasks</b> in
            the <a href="GettingStarted.htm">menu area</a>.
            Click the name of the task to open
            the dialog box for the task, and follow the
            instructions to find features on the map. Results will be
            shown in the <a href="UsingResults.htm">Results</a> section
            of the Console, similar to Identify tool. When you find features,
            highlight one or more 
            by clicking their check-boxes in Results. Then right-click
            on the layer name and choose <b>Zoom To Selected Features</b>. The map
            will zoom to the area surrounding the feature you checked.</li>
            
        <li>Display the <a href="LayersAndToc.htm">Map Contents</a>, if
            not already visible, by clicking its down-arrow in the 
            <a href="GettingStarted.htm#Console">Console</a>.
            Map Contents
            shows the map services and layers in your map. Expand a map
            and its layers nodes in the tree view to show the contents
            of the map.</li>
            
        <li>If enabled, click the check-box next to one or more layers
            to turn the layer on or off. The map will update to reflect
            the visibility settings in Map Contents.</li>
            
        <li>Explore <a href="Default.htm">other content and tools</a> in the map. We hope
            you find this Web mapping application useful and fun!</li>
                
    </ol>
